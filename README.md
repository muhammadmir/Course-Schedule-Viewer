# Introduction
Some schools utilize the services of Ellucian Company to allow students to do several Registrar-related things, including viewing and searching for courses. The software these schools are using is *probably* called [Ellucian Banner](https://www.ellucian.com/solutions/ellucian-banner), which has several functionalities. The functionalities this project is concerned about are the following:
1) the ability to view information about courses like name, description, subject, etc.
2) the interface utilized to display information about courses.
